## 1.1. Database Management System

A database Management System or DBMS is a record keeping software that is designed to store, retrieve, update, and remove date in a database. There are different types of database management system which are as follows:

1. Relational Database
2. Object Oriented Database
3. Hierarchial Database
4. Network Database


## 1.2. Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
A Relational Database Management System is a DBMS  where data is organized in a table. A table contains entries as rows and fields as columns. The following is an example of a relational database management system:

|   id | first_name | last_name | occupation |
| ---: | ---------- | --------- | ---------- |
|    1 | John       | Doe       | Student    |
|    2 | Jane       | Doe       | Instructor |
|    3 | Foo        | Bar       | Baz        |


## 1.3. Features of RDBMS

1. **Representation of real world data**: An RDBMS is able to represent real world data by defining the behavior and attributes of entities.

2. **Relational architecture**: An RDBMS is capable of creating relational tables that have definite attributes with definite data types. This helps in making database more consistent.

3. **Data Efficiency**: An RDBMS takes an approach of normalization to split the relation when the data is having redundancy so that the storage and representation of data becomes more efficient.

4. **Query Language**: An RDBMS is equipped with a query language (Example: SQL) which makes it more efficient to manage the data with less complexity. With the help of query language, we can list, sort, filter, add, remove, modify, and delete multiple entries with the single command.
